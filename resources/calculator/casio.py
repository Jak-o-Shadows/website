A couple of small programs i have made, using casio basic, for the casio fx-9860G
<br />
Bezier calculates the coeffecients of a bezier curve (in parameter form). Can draw, but that is slightly bad
<br />
The code

<a href = "BEZIER.G2M">bezier.g2m</a>
<br />
<br />
Complex is a program to perform complex number iterations. Complex mode must not be set to real.
<br />
The code

<br />
Euler is a program that does Euler's method.

<br />
<br />
VectProd is a program that does the vector product of 2 3D vectors.

<br />
NCalc contains two small programs for calculating the number of samples needed to achieve a pre-determined, and supplied width of a confidence interval. Supports normal distrobution confidence intervals and binomail proportion confidence intervals.
