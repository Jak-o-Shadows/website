contents="""<p><h1>Intro</h1>Working on a robotics project, I needed to determine whether the gyroscope inside my laptop, which is represented a joystick under linux, would be adequate for steering. To that end, I wrote a program to plot joystick value against time. </p>
<h1>Requirements</h1>To run this program, you'll need python 2.7x and the corresponding versions of pygame and matplotlib. Under Windows, the python (x, y) package compilation is the easiest way to get started.</p>
<h1>Use</h1>Run the file using python. It will tell you how many joysticks are plugged in. Enter the number joystick you want to plot, starting from 0. A pygame window will pop up. Once you have gathered enough data, close the pygame window. Your graphs will appear.</p>
<p><h1>Download</h1> Download the latest version: <a href="joystickLogger.py">Joystick Logger Initial Release</a></p>
<p><h1>Images</h1><img src="g1.png" /><img src="g2.png" /></p>
