<h2>Universal Tap Connector</h2>
    <p>Here, i'm gonna explain how to make a quick and easy connector.<br>
      
      <br>
      
      Brief intro.<br>
      
      Water rocket is filling a PET (think coke bottle) with water (1/3),
      
      sealing it, pumping it full of air, and letting it shoot upwards
      
      through the force of the exiting water and air.<br>
      
      <br>
      
      The easiest way to make a launcher, is through gardena type garden hose
      
      connections. However, these don't normally fit too well onto the PET
      
      bottle. However, as i am going to show below, sometimes they do....<br>

      Materials<br>
      
      Universal Tap Adaptor<a

      PET bottle lid.<br>
      
      Drill/screwdriver+hammer<br>
      
      hot glue gun (other glues may work)<br>
      
      <br>
      
      Method<br>
      
      1) Take aprt the universal tap adaptor. It just unscrews. Don't bother
      
      to remove any of the rubber.<br>
      
      2)Make a hole in the PET bottle lid, and the little blue thinng that
      
      comes inside it.<br>
      
      3)Insert like this<a

      4)Take out. Get your hot glue out, and run a bead of glue around the
      
      PET lid, as low as possible. Quickly put in the bottom half of the
      
      universal tap adapter before the glue dries.<br>
      
      5) Jam down hard. Once the glue has dried, you should end up with
      
      something like this.<a

      6) Seal around the edge with more hot glue if neccessary. This is not
      
      desirable, it's just a patch.<br>
      
      7) How to use. Screw it on, use the gardena quick connect thingo.<br>

    <p>Notes**<br />
      If you wish to use a stronger glue, eg epoxy, it is best to score some fairly deep scratches into the PET bottle cap. Otherwise all it does is pull straight out.<br>
